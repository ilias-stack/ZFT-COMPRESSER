# ZFT-COMPRESSER
ZFT-COMPRESSER is a Java-based console application for compressing and decompressing folders using a custom .zft format. This project was made for FUN only and should not be adopted as a serious compressing solution hence it does not compress your folders rather than assembling all their contents inside a decompressable single .ztf file.
